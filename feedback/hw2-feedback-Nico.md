**Overall:**  
Great work on this assignment! You made great use of various pandas, and matplotlib functionality. The only direct advice that I have is to keep on practicing and take note of some of the 'tricks' and best practices that you see in class. I have noticed that you pick up on a lot of the theoretical CS topics (objects, classes, etc.). Keep up with it and practice, practice, practice!

Also, if you would like to discuss your goals with the course, your Dsci career, masters programs, etc., let me know! I would be happy to help.

**Some Notes**  
* In *Question 4*, nice use of a numpy function! Note, though, that you can also just use `DataFrame.dropna()` too!
* In *Question 9*, though it is true that it is not *exactly* normal, what that information could do is just flag the underlying distribution as a cause for concern or suspicion when it comes to making our model. If, for example, we were to build some form of linear regression to predict GRE score and we saw that there was some error, we could flag the non-normal distribution of the data as a cause for error.
* In *Question 13*, though I am sure you are a bit familiar given our most recent classes on classification, note that you would not use an OLS for this problem. You would want to use some form of classification model to solve this supervised learning task.
